# Reason for EduAsk

In the current COVID-19 climate, many schools have turned to home-based learning (HBL) to deliver lessons to students. Where the ever curious students used to ask a plethora of questions to teachers in class and after class before the pandemic, they continue to do the same while at home! While online meetings can still faciliate during class discussion, after class interactions between students and teachers are limited by zoom timeslots and teachers schedule. Students may often message teachers in a group chat or privately to obtain their answers, yet it creates a huge mess when questions and answers are mixed up with casual conversations and are hard to track in the former and teachers get overwhelmed with the number of private messages from students asking probably the same questions. To solve this issue, How2life introduces EduAsk!

# Description of EduAsk

EduAsk is a telegram bot that is able to enable users, in this case the students, to ask question and receive a teacher endorsed reply to it and also to join consultation sessions in the form of telegram group or zoom sessions. It works by linking telegram with google spreadsheets, where questions posted on telegram will be sent to the spreadsheets and can be viewed and answered by users with access to the sheet, in this case the teachers. Students can then ask the question again to check if the question have been answered or the teacher is still viewing it. A 'findall' function is also added to allow students to find other similar questions using keywords. Lastly, students are able to book consultation sessions of their prefered timeslots with teachers using the consultation command, where they will be directed to the teacher during the slot if present and their respective zoom meeting / telegram consultation group.
